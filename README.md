# p2pnetwork

A peer-to-peer network that I created for my Distributed Systems class.


## Design

## Tools
- I used the package [Scapy](https://scapy.net) to write an algorithm that can detect what other devices are on my network
- I used BSD sockets to establish connections between nodes because they are implemented in [Python's socket library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html), and so I figured it would be a library that had a lot of documentation already
